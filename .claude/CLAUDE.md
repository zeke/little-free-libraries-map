# Little Free Libraries Map Project Guidelines

## KML File

**IMPORTANT**: The `libraries.kml` file is READ-ONLY. Do not modify it directly.

The KML data is maintained externally by [Berkeley Little Free Libraries](https://berkeleylfl.wordpress.com) via their Google My Maps. To update the KML file, use the `script/fetch-latest-map-data` script to fetch the latest version from the source.
